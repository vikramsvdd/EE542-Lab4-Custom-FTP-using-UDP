# EE542 Lab4 Custom FTP using UDP
Hello Guys,! Welcome to my GitHub page. Here I along with my teammates have worked on developing our very own baremetal FTP protocol that uses UDP ublike SCP which uses TCP and thus succumbs to its congestion controlling. We have attached the codes for our protocol above, have fun playing with it. There are several versions. We have tested our code out in a real AWS environment and have uploaded a detailed [youtube demonstration]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=todOqsPI3iM") . Hope you enjoy!
